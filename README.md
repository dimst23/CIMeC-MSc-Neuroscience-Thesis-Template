# Description

Welcome to the thesis template repository for the MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Center of Brain/Mind Sciences (CIMeC) under the University of Trento, Italy. Here you will find the thesis template as [described in the official website](https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/cognitive-science/graduation). The front cover is a direct port of the word template provided on the website.


# Usage

There are only a few things to change in order to add your own information in the template.

- **`preamble.tex`**: Here you can add your own packages if you want. At line 63 there is a block which contains the PDF metadata. There add your `title` and `name` as designated in the relevant fields. You can also add some keywords, or completely delete that field if you'd like. Keywords help machines reading your PDF get the essence what is it about and categorize it.
- **`main.tex`**: Here you can add your `title` and `name` again in the relevant sections at lines 6-7. If you want a specific date then add that in the format of `April 2024`.
- **`glossary.tex`**: Here you define any terms you have and so on. There are planty of tutorials on how to use glossaries in latex.
